<h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>
<p>My name is Nicolas Tirio, but I go by Nic for short (without a 'k', long story).</p> 
<p>I am a senior at Lewis (3+1 CS program), with this being my final semester before graduating. 
I'm not sure exactly where I want to land yet in the field of software development, so I'm open to learning many new things!</p>
<h2><u>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</u></h2>
<ul>
  <li>I hope to learn how to make a deliverable product.</li>
  <li>I want to build upon my web development skills.</li>
  <li>I'm hoping to make something that will catch the attention of a future employer.</li>
</ul>
<h2><u>My Favorite Hobby/Activity</u></h2>
<p>Currently, my favorite hobbies are working-out and playing online games with my friends. I am also into cars, as I have a 1991 Nissan 300zx Twin Turbo that is always broken.</p>
<h2><u>Fun Fact</u></h2>
<p>I always have extra bolts after working on my cars, I'm not sure where they come from or where they're supposed to be.</p>
